- I was fortunate to collaborate with a remote team called Toucans03 in the Chingu Voyage program. Moto has a Pomodoro timer, MIT (most important task) checklist, TODO, inspirational quotes, and a work-in-progress weather forecast.
    I was responsible for the Pomodoro Timer, dynamic backgrounds, MoTo's logo, GitHub workflow for pull requests and merges, two blog posts,
    which are part of a series ofr voyage logs.

- Built a Pomodoro Timer as part of the features for MoTo, a Momentum clone app. The Pomodoro contains basic play, stop, and reset functionalities. 
It has a short break of five minutes, a longer break of fifteen minutes, and a twenty-five minutes time block for work. The play button has a fill animation
