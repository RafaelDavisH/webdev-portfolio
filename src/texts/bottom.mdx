    - 👨‍💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v13-toucans-team-03) - 🚀 [Site](https://moto-toucans03.netlify.com/)
    - I was fortunate to collaborate with a remote team called Toucans03 in the Chingu Voyage program. Moto has a Pomodoro timer, MIT (most important task) checklist, TODO, inspirational quotes, and a work-in-progress weather forecast.

    which are part of a series ofr voyage logs.
