##### NPM NBA 2020 Playoff Library

- _September 20, 2020_ | 👨‍💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/RafaelDavisH/playoff-2020) - 🚀 [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playoffs-2020)
- After learning with Kent C. Dodds on 'How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library', I worked on a package called 'Lakers 2020 roster'. Then after, I decided to work on a more elaborated package and potentially useful library. I simply implemented a library to run a random function and JSON structuring helped me accomplished this.

##### Job Wishlist App

- _July 05, 2020_ | 👨‍💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/RafaelDavisH/job-wishlist-app) - 🚀 [site](https://rg6ug.csb.app/)
- Built a React application with dummy data initially to test and style cards. Implemented useState hook to set the initial state with an empty array. Used localStorage and useEffect to keep localStorage updated.

##### Color Palette Generator

- _June 14, 2020_ | 👨‍💻 [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-color-pallet-generator-f39od) - 🚀 [site](https://csb-f39od.netlify.app/)
- Built Color Palette Generator using with React and State Hook. I learned to trigger "copy to clipboard" when an individual
  color card gets clicked. Similar to Color Flipper app, this app also randomly generates an hex color by iterate through an array
  with numbers and letters (0-9, A-F), but setting in state an array of five hex colors. I added some hover animations with Tailwind CSS.
  I was not able to add two more features which are: When pressing "C" all five hex colors would by copied to the clipboard, and pressing
  the Tab bar it would generate new random colors.

##### Color Flipper

- _June 12, 2020_ | 👨‍💻 [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-color-flipper-w3e15) - 🚀 [site](https://csb-w3e15.netlify.app/)
- Built a Color Flipper App using with React and State Hook. I learned how to dynamically generate hex colors by randomly iterate through
  an array with numbers and letters (0-9, A-F). I used Helmet and useState to change the color for the body background and span element
  text color. I'm continuing to experiment with Tailwind CSS to add style.

##### Tic Tac Toe

- _June 10, 2020_ | 👨‍💻 [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-tic-tac-toe-scrimbaremix-v5jzy) - 🚀 [site](https://csb-v5jzy.netlify.app/)
- Built a Tic Tac Toe game using modern React and React Hooks. I learned how to destructure props, create states, and to
  implement Time Travel functionalities by using each move's unique ID to jump to previous moves. I used Tailwind CSS for the majority of styling.

- Built a Pomodoro Timer as part of the features for MoTo, a Momentum clone app. The Pomodoro contains basic play, stop, and reset functionalities.
  It has a short break of five minutes, a longer break of fifteen minutes, and a twenty-five minutes time block for work. The play button has a fill animation
  that progresses as time comes to completion.
