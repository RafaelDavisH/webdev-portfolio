  Hi 👋 there!
</Text>

I'm a web developer passionate about all things JavaScript and ☕ coffee enthusiast based out
of the City of Angeles. A career changer, who is always seeking to grow as an individual and a professional.
Self-driven, problem-solver, and very interested to experiment with new programming technologies.
Most importantly, I am a family man 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, friend 🧔🏽, drummer 🥁, artist 🎨, adventurer ⛺, and a 
technology aficionado 🛸. 

<br />

Check out my current [projects](#projects) and latest [blog posts](/blog) to catch up on 
where I'm at in my developer journey. <p className="underline text-center">[Perhaps, you want to chat about working on your site 📧](#contact)</p>.
