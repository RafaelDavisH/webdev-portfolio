[MoTo](https://chingu-voyages.github.io/v13-toucans-team-03/index.html), which is the name of our app that stands for [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/) Toucans, is starting to take form. With our first draft sketches and wireframes in place, each of us took a feature or responsibility to work on this week.

## Weekly Debriefing

Our weekly meetings starts by going over 3 key questions and it is followed by any suggestions. These questions are answered by each member preferably before our weekly meeting on a google doc that we all have access to. This ensures that we all have clear answers from each member and without any misunderstandings. If we have completed our weeks' self-assigned feature, we take any available feature or keep working on the previous feature if needed.

Three important features got started last week, which I believe are the foundation of our app.
These are:
- Layout: HTML, and CSS.
- Responsiveness: Responsive layout to automatically adjust to mobile and larger screens.
- Time: Showing current time.

We had a few roadblocks this past week in our Github workflow, but nothing serious. Mostly was us getting familiar with [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/), and our Pull Request steps process.

## Week's Tasks and Features
- [Ming](https://medium.com/@mingyong), who worked on the responsiveness feature, will continue to work the mobile responsiveness and the Team info popup modal to display at full screen. Also, Ming published our first sprint [blog post](https://medium.com/@mingyong/chingu-voyage-log-getting-ready-in-sprint-1-ba611ee4d210). 
- [Ola](https://medium.com/@zaynaibg), was responsible on keeping everyone on track with MVP, and UX/UI tasks. Ola will take the Weather API and script feature to work in sprint 4.
- [Sophia Li](@sophia_wyl), worked on the time feature and will take the Quotes feature.
- I, [RafaelDavish](@rafaeldavish), worked on the HTML and CSS and will take on the Pomodoro feature.

## My Experience

It's my first voyage, and my first time working with a remote team. I have to say, I am loving every minute of this [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 13. What I enjoyed the most is when we put our heads together to come out with the app idea. This process is exciting for me because I believe this is when my most creative ideas are born and I can imagine the possibilities.

## Whats Next?

We have more features to work on for this app, things to fix, test and finally, the app deployment. I am looking forward to see the finished product. Next week is Thanksgiving, and I am definitely thankful for team Toucans 3!
