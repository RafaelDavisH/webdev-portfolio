  👨🏽‍💻 Web Developer at Work!
</Text>

I'm a career changer, who is always seeking to learn to grow as an individual and a professional.
I'm self-driven, problem-solver, and very interested to experiment with new 
programming technologies. Most importantly, I am a family man 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, friend 🧔🏽, drummer 🥁, artiest 🎨, explorer ⛺, and a technology enthusiast 🛸.
