  👨🏽‍💻 Freelance Web Developer
</Text>

I've 4 plus years of experience confidently providing useful and cater service to customers and their brands. 
I'm self-managed and resourceful, able to manage web development from design to delivery and after-sale customer support.
I can help you if you are projecting to generate and turn more leads online and looking for a results-driven approach.
I concentrate on crafting compelling copy for landing pages that are test-driven to target your ideal audience and highly focused on getting results. 
I prefer to work on projects that are being freshly built. I will not acquire jobs that expect me to inherit code from a previous developer. I also favor working with clients that are generally able to respond to questions or requests during the evening hours (PST) on 
weekdays and try to respond within 48 hours of communication.
